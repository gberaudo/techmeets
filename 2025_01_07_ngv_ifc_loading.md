# IFC models loading in CesiumJS

## IFC models?

The "Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)" is a data schema to describe architectural, building and construction.
It is commonly used in "Building Information Modeling (BIM)" projects.

## geoblocks/ifc-gltf (frontend)

This [geoblock](https://github.com/geoblocks/ifc-gltf) allows to convert an IFC file directly in the browser.

```js
const element = document.createElement('div');
const ifcUrl = "https://thatopen.github.io/engine_components/resources/small.ifc";
const {glb, coordinationMatrix, metadata} = await ifcToGLTF({
  element: element,
  url: ifcUrl,
})
```

Et voil√†, you receive:

- `glb`, the binary version of a [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)
- `coordinationMatrix`, the transformation matrix to position the model (unfortunately, usually the identity matrix);
- `metadata`, some metadata associated with the IFC.

You can then load that model into [CesiumJS](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/) or any other 3D engine supporting glTF.

## Integration inside NGV

[NGV](https://github.com/geoblocks/ngv) is our framework for building 3D applications.

You can add an IFC "layer" with:

```ts
export interface INGVIFC {
  type: 'ifc';
  url: string;
  options?: {
    modelOptions: Omit<INGVCesiumModelConfig['options'], 'url'>;
  };
  position: [number, number];
  height: number;
  rotation: number;
}
```

## Cesium Ion (backend)

Cesium is currently working on IFC support in there coming AECO support.

We are part of the program and will test this backend solution.
